However, the customer service has always been accommodating and prompt with the exchanges. It would be great if they could improve the sizing accuracy, but overall, I'm satisfied with the shopping experience.' ",

The sales associates were helpful, though, and the store ambiance is pleasant. If the prices were more competitive, I'd be more inclined to shop here regularly.' ",
